9️⃣ API Comparison Tool (🔥 Rare Feature)
Compare two API responses:
/users (today) vs /users (yesterday)

Show difference:

Added fields
Removed fields
Changed type



2️⃣ RATE LIMITING (ANTI-SPAM / DDOS PROTECTION)
🧠 Idea:
Ek user → kitni requests per minute allowed?

Limit: 100 requests / 60 sec (set agar, defult mai agar limit pura ho jata h, no access varna last call)


Agar cross kare:

{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "retry_after": "30 seconds"
}

🔥 Benefit:
Server overload se bachaata hai
Abuse detect hota hai



9️⃣ API VERSION LOCKING
Prevent breaking change:

/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users

User must upgrade manually.



🚀 1. API BEHAVIOR PROFILING (Very Powerful)
Normal response time: 120ms
Current response: 1500ms ⚠️

🔥 Use case:
Slow API detection
Silent backend issues
